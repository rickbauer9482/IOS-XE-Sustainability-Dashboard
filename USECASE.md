# Description:

This is an example of how to use Model-Driven Telemetry, Telegraf, InfluxdB, and Grafana (TIG Stack) to visualize the sustainability telemetry from Cisco IOS-XE devices.

# The Challenge:

•	Sustainability has become a hot topic
•	Not all customers use Catalyst Center as the Command and Control Center for their Campus Networks
•	Some customers prefer a Do it Yourself (DIY) OpenSource approach for their tooling
•	Legacy Pull solutions like SNMP and Syslog do not provide information fast enough 

# The Goal:

•	To provide a Sustainability Dashboard based on modern approaches (MDT) and OpenSource tools

# The Solution:

•	Telemetry subscriptions from Cisco IOS-XE devices to provide sub-second resolution to visualize sustainability data in a TIG Stack 

# The Results:

•	Quick and easy DIY solution to visualize telemetry data from Cisco IOS-XE devices

# Business Summary:

•	Simple, relevant, and flexible telemetry data visualized in a lightweight, easily deployed solution
